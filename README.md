# REST-API
This is a Restful CRUD API made for accessing different textbooks. It uses JWT authentication for API access. I tried to replicate the design of ISBN Books API and created this basic TextBookDB API. It is developed using NodeJS, ExpressJS framework and MongoDB.
Access the API from here:- http://textbookdbapi.herokuapp.com/
